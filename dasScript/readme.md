# Background
This started with an inquiry into how playwrights should document their *plays*
And wondering why plays have looked the same for awhile.
For example, *The Importance of Being Earnest* [as published in a book](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.553513/page/n19):
!(/example/example_media/Importance-book.png)

Or as you can see it [on Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/844/844-h/844-h.htm):

# Project Inquiry
Why is it that dialogue/text is the most valued element of a script?
There is much confusion in plays about **who** wrote the stage directions—the easily ignorable, sometimes said to be added by publishers descriptions of what happened in the original production, but sometimes the playwright is specific about them, but *Shakespeare* barely uses them!

My thinking is that it is intuitive to express oneself using sound, gifs, YouTube clips, text-animation effects, so why cant scripts accommodate?

And further, how do we share authorship of works created in a collaborative, horizontally structured ensemble? How do we allow each new production of a script add their contributions and discoveries. Whether that is alterations or dramaturgical research?

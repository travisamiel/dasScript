paint a self portrait with the PB + J
~~~

Every time I’m with my dad he looks at me and says that my nose is looking good. That my face is growing around it. And it looks a lot better and I’m becoming very handsome.

~~~
pause
~~~

One day I would like to be hot.

~~~
resume painting
~~~

In my head I’m not sure what I look like, because I can’t see me, and although I’m constantly looking at myself in the mirror and documenting myself with photos and drawings, when I try and think about what I look like…

~~~
wave hand over face
~~~

I constantly walk away from mirrors remembering that very purposefully none of my goals in life can be inhibited by the way I look.

Still I’d like to reconcile the three:
* this me in front of me— that I don’t know
* the me in my head that’s in front of you
* and this ideal me, that’s always a reach

~~~
collide portrait and face
~~~

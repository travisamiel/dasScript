<h1>dasScript</h1>
<p>A project by Travis Amiel to upend the status quo of the American Theater.</p>
<p>For too long, live performance has been crushed by the legacy of Aristotle's unities and Eug√®ne Scribe's well-made play model.</p>
<p>It's time for a better-made play</p>
<h2>goals</h2>
<ol>
  <li>displace dialogue as the most vital element of a script, in favor of equal significance placed in all media/mediums/action in performance</li>
  <li>model collaborative non-heirarchical script development, using digital infrastructure owned by the artist</li>
  <li>cumulatively collect dramaturgical and process artifacts/materials (i.e. how many dramaturgs on productions of <em>proof</em> have compiled the same info on math)</li>
</ol>

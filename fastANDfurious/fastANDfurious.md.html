> I am the tunnel connecting the L train from Brooklyn to Manhattan. These are my wires. I have to be repaired. Imagine I threw this glitter onto the floor. That's how bad the damage is to the tunnel, we were told. That's why it was going to shut down. Because this benching along the side needed to be replaced.

> I am an extremely optimistic person, like if Pee-Wee Herman and Kenneth the Page and Buddy the Elf Janet and Spongebob Squarepants all came together into one person...that's me. I trusted the system that told me it needed to be shut down. Because at the end of the day I always get home.

> Every time I go to the movies I hear the same elderly version of myself ask, **why do all these movies have guns**?
> When I really think about, I don't think I could get a gun if I wanted to kill someone, or myself.
> And I'm really grateful for that.
> ~~When I read about the AIDs crisis it always sounds like my gay ancestors had boyfriends. I'm always detracted from the "love wins" narrative of queer activism because I've never been in love. And to me this isn't about love. To be honest <span class="blinking">this</span> is all about lust & shame.~~[^dec18-post]

# Footnotes
[^dec18-post]: I didn't end up saying the bit about AIDs because I felt (feel?) uncomfortable about it. I started by talking about this costume I had made: a piece of muslin with nipples drawn on and yellow sweat thread sewn on. There were 15 people in the audience so I reminded everyone to take one fifteenth of banana.

[^feb19-post]: I'm told that a *song* has to contain lyrics. But I'm also told that it doesn't. Please let me know what you know.

**Fast & Furious Scripts**

Performed at the Tank for their Fast & Furious series. Each responding to the most recent week of events.

# March 2019: Experimental Performance Artist Travis Amiel
## concept
I wrote headlines (e.g. Michael Cohen testified in front of congress) and actions (e.g. stamp your foot three times) on pieces of paper, then folded it into a paper airplane. From the booth, I threw the airplanes.

## instructions
* Asked to be introduced as "experimental performance artist travis amiel", so I could joke about my request for audience participation
* After my introduction I asked an audience member to demo picking up a paper, reading, and then following the instructions
* When ready, I signaled to the booth for the piece's soundtrack to play, and then I ran yelling up to the booth [^mar19-post]
* Sound clip used for performance:

> Last week, Quadriga CX filed court documents saying that they are unable to access over $145 million in various crypto currencies because their recently deceased founder was the only one with the passwords.
> Learning from their mistakes, I have prepared for my death by transcribing my bitcoin wallet key into a song. In the event of my death, please decrypt this performance, liquidate my 0.00635 in Bitcoin, and donate it to The Tank. [^feb19-post]

> I am the tunnel connecting the L train from Brooklyn to Manhattan. These are my wires. I have to be repaired. Imagine I threw this glitter onto the floor. That's how bad the damage is to the tunnel, we were told. That's why it was going to shut down. Because this benching along the side needed to be replaced. [Second Avenue Sagas breaks it down](https://secondavenuesagas.com/2019/01/04/a-deep-dive-into-gov-cuomos-move-to-force-the-mta-to-abandon-the-l-train-shutdown/).

> The existing infrastructure will **stay**. And new wires will be laid.
> I just worry.

## when i need a break

> I am an extremely optimistic person, like if Pee-Wee Herman and Kenneth the Page and Buddy the Elf Janet and Spongebob Squarepants all came together into one person...that's me. I trusted the system that told me it needed to be shut down. Because at the end of the day I always get home.

> Every time I go to the movies I hear the same elderly version of myself ask, **why do all these movies have guns**?
> When I really think about, I don't think I could get a gun if I wanted to kill someone, or myself.
> And I'm really grateful for that.
> ~~When I read about the AIDs crisis it always sounds like my gay ancestors had boyfriends. I'm always detracted from the "love wins" narrative of queer activism because I've never been in love. And to me this isn't about love. To be honest <span class="blinking">this</span> is all about lust & shame.~~[^dec18-post]

# Footnotes
[^mar19-post]: I was imagining a sort of comedic [Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) happening, which I think was effective.

[^feb19-post]: I'm told that a *song* has to contain lyrics. But I'm also told that it doesn't. Please let me know what you know.

[^dec18-post]: I didn't end up saying the bit about AIDs because I felt (feel?) uncomfortable about it. I started by talking about this costume I had made: a piece of muslin with nipples drawn on and yellow sweat thread sewn on. There were 15 people in the audience so I reminded everyone to take one fifteenth of banana.
